    <h2>Proposition: States with a decrease in the number of abortion clinics saw a significant decline in abortion rates between 2017 and 2020.</h2>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>FOR the proposition: scattered plot and regression line for relationship between abortion clinics and abortion rate</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Using a regression trend line and confidence interval. 
Score: 1. 
Rational: Adding a regression trend line (dashed red) and a shaded confidence interval makes the relationship between abortion clinic changes and abortion rate changes appear more structured and correlated to each other. The regression line shows an upward correlation, which persuades the reader that a higher number of clinics leads to increased abortion rates. While this is a legitimate statistical approach, the choice of a linear model may not capture non-linear patterns, slightly influencing interpretation. And this only presents a rough trend given multiple datasets. It doesn’t take outliers or single cases into consideration.
</li>
				<li>Correlation coefficient. Score: 2. Rationale: Displaying the correlation coefficient (r) provides a quantitative measure of the relationship, making the visualization more informative and credible. This is a standard statistical measure that informs the reader about the strength and direction of the relationship, making the claim more transparent and objective.</li>
				<li>Scatter plot with small dots. Score: 1.5. Rationale: Using small dots reduces visual clutter and makes it easier to see the distribution of data points, which improves readability without distorting the data. Larger dots could have been used, but they might overlap and obscure the data. Smaller dots were chosen to ensure clarity. However, small dots may be harder to read easily from the graph.

</li>
			<li>Choices of axes and labels. Score: 1. Rationale: The x-axis represents the percentage change in abortion clinics, while the y-axis represents the percentage change in abortion rates. The scaling is neutral and does not distort the data. However, the y-axis is truncated, so the trend might be slightly exaggerated. This could be deceptive and undermine the credibility of the relationship.

</li></ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

      <figure>

				<figcaption>AGAINST the proposition: Change in abortion rates and abortion clinic availability across all U.S. states</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Dual y-axis representation. Score: 2. Rationale: Using a dual-axis allows the viewer to compare the percentage changes in abortion clinics and abortion rates more directly. This visualization choice emphasizes that abortion rates do not always decline when clinics close and may even increase in some cases. And because both y-axes are labeled and scaled in the same way, this is an earnest design decision.</li>
				<li>Ordering states alphabetically instead of by trend. Score: 1.5. Rationale: Displaying states in alphabetical order prevents a biased narrative that could arise from ordering them by correlation strength. An alphabetically sorted order avoids drawing the viewer’s attention to any particular state. However, it may take longer for the viewer to identify patterns. </li>
				<li>Inclusion of outliers. Score: 2. Since this graph contains all data points, it does not omit extreme values, including states where abortion rates increased despite clinic closures. By keeping all data points, it avoids cherry-picking results to fit a particular argument. This is a very earnest decision, as it allows the audience to see the full range of outcomes.</li>
			</ul>

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <p>Designing both visualizations required balancing clarity, persuasion, and ethical responsibility. The first step was choosing appropriate visual encodings—using line graphs, scattered plots, colors and dual axes to highlight trends while maintaining interpretability. The more challenging part was ensuring that design choices did not unintentionally mislead the audience. For example, using a dual-axis chart may risk overemphasizing correlations, while sorting data differently could have implied stronger trends than actually existed. What surprised me most was how small decisions—such as whether to connect data points with lines—could subtly influence interpretation. For example, in the first scattered plot visualization, the data points are presented as scattered dots, while in the second line chart, the data points are connected to emphasize percentage increase or decrease.</p>
    <p>The ethical implications of my design choices revolve around the responsibility to present data truthfully while making it engaging and persuasive to support or challenge my proposition. Ethical visualization requires avoiding distortions that could mislead the audience, either by exaggerating trends or obscuring important nuances. In these visualizations, one key ethical concern was the use of a dual-axis chart, which, while effective for comparing trends, can create an illusion of correlation where is not the highlighted purpose of the graph. Another ethical consideration is the selection and ordering of data. Choosing how to sort states, whether by magnitude of change or alphabetically, influences how patterns are perceived. While an alphabetical order might seem neutral, an order based on percentage change could emphasize perceived trends, making them appear more systematic than they actually are.</p></section>
